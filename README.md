# seth.dev

This repo holds a very minimal landing page for my domain ([sethvanwieringen.dev](https://sethvanwieringen.dev)) that I use for experimenting or hosting demo or hobby projects. It's a learning project mainly. It's hosted on a Hetzner cloud instance with a Nginx reverse proxy that serves various sites/services that each live in LXC containers. Some projects are hosted on external platforms, such as Netlify, Azure, Google Cloud or Vercel.

*Note that (for now) I've used a very hacky/development approach to including tailwind.css by just adding a CDN and empty config file. Don't copy this approach for anything remotely serious.*
